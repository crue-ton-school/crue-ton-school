- 👋 Hi, I’m @crue-ton-school
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, music, and video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, piano, and maybe picking up electric guitar!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really nothing, this is for school related projects for when I'm helping out fellow classmates on stuff like coding courses.
- 📫 How to reach me, don't really have a method of contact, but my main github page for personal projects is [`@crue-ton`](https://github.com/crue-ton)
